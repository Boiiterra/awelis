# webmark

Web markdown. \
Little program to preview markdown files using browser.
You need to point to specific file in order for server to work properly.
It will track live changes and display them (But you will
need to save file to view changes).

## Why?

I don't want to use VSCode for editing markdown.
If there is something else that allows me to preview markdown easily I won't
use it... Cuz I will use this.
